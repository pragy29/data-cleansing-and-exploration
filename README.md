# Data Cleansing and Exploration Project

## Overview
This project involves data cleansing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of transactional retail data from an online electronics store in Melbourne, Australia. The project focuses on identifying and fixing anomalies, removing outliers, and imputing missing data.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleansing**: Detects and fixes errors in a dataset of retail transactions.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and removes outlier rows based on delivery charges.
- **Missing Data Imputation**: Imputes missing values in the dataset.

## Setup and Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run the provided notebook.
- **Required Libraries**: Install the following packages:
  ```sh
  pip install pandas numpy scipy nltk
  ```
### Running the Project
- Open the Jupyter notebook (31940757_Assessment.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Run the code to clean the data, detect outliers, and impute missing values.
- Check the output CSV files to ensure the data has been cleaned and processed correctly.

### Input Files
- **Dirty Data:** A CSV file containing transactional retail data with possible anomalies.
- **Outlier Data:** A CSV file where outliers are to be detected and removed.
- **Missing Data:** A CSV file with missing values to be imputed.

### Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach to data cleansing:
  - Fixing Errors: Identifies and corrects syntactic, semantic, and coverage anomalies in the data.
  - Removing Outliers: Detects and removes outliers based on the delivery charges attribute.
  - Imputing Missing Values: Uses appropriate imputation techniques for missing data.

### Documentation
The Jupyter notebook contains detailed documentation, including:
  - Methodology: Steps to clean the data, detect outliers, and impute missing values.
  - Code Comments: Clear comments explaining each step and decision.
  - Results Explanation: Explanation of intermediate and final results for clarity.
